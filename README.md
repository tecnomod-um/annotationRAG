# **RAG-Based Multi-Ontology Annotation Framework**

This repository contains the code, experiments, and analysis for a study proposing a new **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach tailored for the automated annotation of biological sample metadata.

## **Overview**

Traditional metadata annotation pipelines often rely on single-ontology retrieval or focus on isolated biological sample categories, which limits the richness and robustness of the resulting annotations. In this study, we introduce a **two-stage RAG-based method** designed to overcome these limitations:

1. **Interpretation Stage**
   The *GPT-5-mini* model infers and extracts contextual information from each biological sample label, producing an enriched and standardized interpretation.

2. **Annotation Stage**
   This refined interpretation is used as input to generate more accurate, ontology-aligned annotations with *GPT-4o-mini*.

To support the retrieval phase, we use a **reduced and semantically focused subset** of four major biological ontologies. This compact knowledge base minimizes noise, improves similarity search precision, and avoids the computational overhead of large-scale ontology retrieval.

Unlike most previous studies:

* We annotate **across up to four ontologies**, enabling richer multi-dimensional metadata standardization.
* We cover **three biological entity categories** — *cell lines*, *cell types*, and *anatomical structures* — expanding the scope beyond single-type annotation approaches.
* Our pipeline is designed to **automate the majority of the annotation workflow**, while keeping human validation as a final quality-control layer.
